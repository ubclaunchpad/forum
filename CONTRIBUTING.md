# Contributing to Forum

We would love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Developing workflow

All code changes happen through pull requests.

We use the `main` branch for active changes/additions. The `main` branch is protected, and all changes must be made through pull requests.

1. Create your branch from `main`.
2. Make changes/additions.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. Ensure all tests pass.
5. Issue a pull request!

At least one reviewer must approve the pull request to enable merging to `main`. Code owners will automatically be added to the pull request.
